			"name": "Adamantine",
			"description": "<p>This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/&ndash; if it&rsquo;s light armor, 2/&ndash; if it&rsquo;s medium armor, and 3/&ndash; if it&rsquo;s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.</p>\n<p>Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Type of Adamantine Item</th>\n<th>Item Cost Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Ammunition</td>\n<td>+60 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Light armor</td>\n<td>+5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Medium armor</td>\n<td>+10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Heavy armor</td>\n<td>+15,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Shield</td>\n<td>+2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Weapon</td>\n<td>+3,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

			"description": "<p>This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties.
