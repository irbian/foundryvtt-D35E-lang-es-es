She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the <em>atonement </em>spell description), as appropriate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Some description after&nbsp; Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. © 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.

While most succumb to madness, some can channel their emotions to make raw psionic powers grow and expand, often beyond the capabilities of other more tame minds. This ability does not come cheap, however, and some of the Wilders pay the ultimate price, laughing their last laugh when annihilating the minds of their foes along with their own.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The wilder’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Autohypnosis* (Wis), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration* (Con), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (psionics)* (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Psicraft* (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">*New skill or expanded use of existing skill.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level: </strong>(4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Artwork by Dean Spencer.</span></p>"

The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The wizard’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).
