Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bowshaped even when unstrung. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp. For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls. For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a –2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage. The bow can’t grant him a higher bonus than he already has.</p>\n<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

		"Sling": {
			"name": "Sling",
			"description": "<p>A sling hurls lead bullets. It doesn’t shoot as far as a crossbow, nor is it as powerful as a bow, but it’s cheap and easy to improvise from common materials. Druids and halflings favor slings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you (for instance, 1d3 instead of 1d4, or 1d2 instead of 1d3) and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>"

		"Sling Bullet": {
			"name": "Sling Bullet",
			"description": "<p>Bullets are lead spheres, much heavier than stones of the same size. They come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>"

		"Spear": {
			"name": "Spear",
			"description": "<p>One of the simplest weapons in existence, the spear is favored by druids and sorcerers. It can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>"

		"Spiked Chain": {
			"name": "Spiked Chain",
			"description": "<p>A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe. Because the chain can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped. When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (page 102) to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.</p>"
		},
		"Spiked Gauntlet": {
			"name": "Spiked Gauntlet",
			"description": "<p>Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.</p>"

		"Throwing Axe": {
			"name": "Throwing Axe",
			"description": "<p>A throwing axe is lighter than a handaxe and balanced for throwing. Gnome fighters often use throwing axes for both melee and ranged attacks.</p>"
		},
		"Trident": {
			"name": "Trident",
			"description": "<p>This three-tined piercing weapon can be thrown just as a shortspear or spear can be, but its range increment is shorter because it’s not as aerodynamic as those other weapons. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>"
		},
		"Two-Bladed Sword": {
			"name": "Two-Bladed Sword",
			"description": "<p>A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page 160). A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>"

		"Unarmed Strike": {
			"name": "Unarmed Strike",
			"description": "<p>A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike, which may be a punch, kick, head butt, or other type of attack. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls. An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat (page 102) to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.</p>"

			"name": "Warhammer",

		"Whip": {
			"name": "Whip",
			"description": "<p>A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes). Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon. Because a whip can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with a it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped. When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails). You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (page 102) to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.</p>"
